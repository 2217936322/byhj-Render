# How to Buil

 1. Make sure you develop environment is right.
 2. You can build the environment by yourself according your target.
 3. Project Organization:

		  |Root

              |-- include
              |-- src
              |-- media

 Notice: I use the Visual Studio project props file to share the project setting.

         The output dir:

              |-- bin(Execute Dir)
              |-- temp(temp file we possibly not need)
